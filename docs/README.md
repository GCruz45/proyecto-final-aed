# proyecto-final-aed
This proyect is the final proyect of the algorithms and data structures course of 2019-2 from ICESI University, at Cali, Colombia.
Here you may find implementations on a Graph Data Structure, alongside its different algorithms. The intended end of this proyect is to solve different competitive programation problems that require of a graph data structure and algorithms applied on it. And then represent the solution to said problems on a graphic interface.
